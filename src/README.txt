Task 1 (done with teacher)
------

* walk through the code of the skybox drawing


Task 2 [1 point]      >>> TASK 4_2-Y <<<
----------------
Draw the explosion animation represented as a sequence of 16 images repeatedly changing 
over the time. Whole sequence of images is stored in one big image in 8x2 layout 
(8 columns and 2 rows) -> see image data/explode.png. Explosion animation is mapped 
onto a billboard (simple rectangle) that is automatically rotated to always
face the camera.

* Initial texture mapping has to be done in file data.h through the explosionVertexData[]
  array. You have to append initial texture coordinates to stretch the texture over the
  whole billboard (later inside the fragment shader, the initial texture window 1.0x1.0
  will be remapped into the proper subimage i.e. frame of the animation through sampleTexture
  function).    >>> TASK 4_2-1 <<<

* Texture animation is accomplished by changing texture coordinates over the time according
  to the passed animation frame number (ranges for 0 to number of frames minus one), i.e the
  input texture coordinates from the initial mapping (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0) has to be remapped
  to select proper subimage (animation frame) from the big texture. To do that, you have to complete
  function sampleTexture() in fragment shader explosion.frag. Texture layout is stored in uniform
  named "pattern".    >>> TASK 4_2-3 <<<

* Explosion texture has to be blended with the background. You have to enable blending and
  set proper blending factors. In this case the texture is simply added to the background
  -> drawExplosion() in file render_stuff.cpp.  >>> TASK 4_2-2 <<<

* note: Through the EXPLOSION_TEXTURE_NAME constant in file render_stuff.cpp, you can change
  the name of the texture to be used for explosion animation -> for debugging purposes
  you can use a texture with digits (file digits.png) to see if the animation frames are
  switching in proper order. 


Task 3 [1 point]      >>> TASK 4_3-Y <<<
----------------
Mapping of texture with "game over" text to the triangle strip. Texture movement has to be
done through the transformation of texture coordinates in the vertex shader.

* Animate "game over" text movement by shifting the texture coordinates inside the vertex shader
  stored in file banner.vert. Offset should be derived from the "time" uniform and its calculation
  has to ensure that text will scroll through the whole window in one second. In final version
  time has to be replaced by localTime just to slow down the movement of the text. 
  >>> TASK 4_3-4 <<<

* At the beggining, the "game over" text has to appear on the left and it should move to the right.
  When it completely rolls out the window, it has to emerge from the window left side again .
  >>> TASK 4_3-1 <<< 

* Triangle strip has to be subdivided in the direction of the u texture coordinate into tree parts, 
  but the texture has to be visible just on one part each time. You have to assign texture coordinates
  correctly in array bannerVertexData[] in file data.h.     >>> TASK 4_3-Y <<<

* Texture (i.e. "game over" text) has to be displayed on the triangle strip only ones. Therefore, you
  have to set the proper texture wrap mode (wrap or clamp) in file render_stuff.cpp within
  initBannerGeometry() function.    >>> TASK 4_3-3 <<<

* Texture has to be blended with the background. You have to enable blending and set the proper blending
  factors. Texture contains the alpha channel (texels of the text have alpha value set to 1.0 and the
  others are set to 0.0) and therefore, it has to be mixed with the background with respect to the alpha
  component of the incoming fragment color (i.e. text is opaque, so we see either the text or the
  background) -> drawBanner() in file render_stuff.cpp.  >>> TASK 4_3-2 <<<


Notes:
------
* "e" key press generates an explosion randomly placed in the scene 
* "g" key press terminates the game -> generates rolling text "game over"

* parts of the source code that should be modified to fullfill the tasks are marked
  by the following sequence of comments where X indicates the task number and Y the 
  subtask number:

    // ======== BEGIN OF SOLUTION - TASK 3_X-Y ======== //
